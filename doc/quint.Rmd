This package implements in R the Qualitative interaction trees method (QUINT).

QUINT looks for qualitative interactions in two-arm randomized control trials using
binary regression trees. This is, it finds out subgroups of clients (patients) for 
which one treatment is optimal while for other subgroups a different treatment is optimal. 
The growth of the binary tree, and therefore, the identification of subgroups 
of clients to a treatment, is defined in terms of pretreatment characteristics.
